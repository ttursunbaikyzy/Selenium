Testing your FIRST code (The Approach):
   1)Tell the project where your webdriver is located.
   2)We have to create an instance of the webdriver.
tip: Every project that is created has to be configured with JAR files and drivers.
Command:
   thread.sleep(3000);
      => it will show millis before 3000 as milliseconds.

Difference between driver.get and driver.navigate =>
   With navigate you can use driver.navigate().back(); command as well.
   driver.navigate().forward();
   driver.navigate().refresh();
GET will wait until the whole page is loaded.
NAVIGATE will NOT wait until the whole page is loaded.
There are two METHODS:
   1)driver.get();
   2)driver.navigate();

Difference between driver.close(); and driver.quit(); =>
   1)CLOSE will close the CURRENT tab.
   2)QUIT will close the WHOLE browser.

Window Size Management =>
   driver.manage().window().maximize();
   driver.manage().window().fullscreen();
