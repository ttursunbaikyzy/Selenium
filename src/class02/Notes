how many locators do we have in selenium?  8 locators:
-ID
-Name
-Class
-LinkText     --> they can only be used with a link and it must have a text  (a link is usually in the tag <a>)
         *tip:** the VALUE of the # is a link.
-Partial Linktext    --> they can only be used with a link
-TagName    --->  just specify the tage that you want to find
        *tip:**  ctrl+f  >> to locate tage use // instead of <
-Xpath
-Css Selector


why do we need so many locators?  :o
-- sometimes there might be a locator with duplicate value
    <input id="email",name="a">
    <input id="email",name="b">

-- sometimes the developers might not provide you with all the locators
    <input class=" ">

there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator....

if attribute value has a number in it, it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator!!!!!


difference in linkTest and partialLinkText?
a partial link text you can use just a part of text, just make sure that it is unique enough to stand out.

What did we learn today???

Locators:
 locators in selenium help us find the WebElements

 8 locators

 id, name, className

 Linktext, partialLinktext (they can only be used for <a> and it must also have some Text)

 TagName (we just need to pass the tagName and it is going find that particular webElement)

 DOM --> document object model
 here we have the whole code for the website

 Scenario:
 if there are two elements with the same attribute value, what will happen?

 selenium is going to get the first one it encounters.
