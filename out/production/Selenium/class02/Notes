how many locators do we have in selenium?  8 locators:
-ID
-Name
-Class
-LinkText     --> they can only be used with a link and it must have a text  (a link is usually in the tag a)
         *tip:** the VALUE of the # is a link.
-Partial Linktext    --> they can only be used with a link
-TagName
-Xpath
-Css Selector


why do we need so many locators?  :o
-- sometimes there might be a locator with duplicate value
    <input id="email",name="a">
    <input id="email",name="b">

-- sometimes the developers might not provide you with all the locators
    <input class=" ">

there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator....

if attribute value has a number in it, it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator!!!!!
